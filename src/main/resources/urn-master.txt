<!-- There are four basic node types:                                                -->
<!-- 1. Airport   - Contains properties like code (eg DFW), city, lat, lon etc.      -->
<!-- 2. Country   - A convenient way to find all airports in a specific country.     -->
<!-- 3. Continent - As above but for continents.                                     -->
